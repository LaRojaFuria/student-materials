# Social Auto-trading algorithmic platform for financial investment products, w/ correlations between: time, weather, geological, and cosmic events on a global scale

## Executive Summary

*The purpose of this project is to design and implement a social trading platform that is based on an algorithm or set of algorithms that will perform educated price predictions, and further automatically execute trades based on said predictions.* 

*These algorithms will be adaptable to any and all financial investment products, including but not limited to: commodities, futures, equities, bonds(both private and Sovereign), credit spreads, options, etc., as well as any derivative(s) of aforementioned, not mentioned, or potential future financial investment products that have not been developed currently.*

*The algorithms will base predictions on data correlations between:*
  
  *Global weather(e.g. hurricanes, droughts, lightning strikes, Global warming, etc.)*
  
  *Global geological events(e.g. volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, etc.) and,*
  
  *Cosmic events(e.g. solar flares, X-rays, Gamma radiation, being swallowed by a black hole, Intergalactic invasion, etc.)*

## Business Objectives

*The primary objective will be to find correlations between: time, weather, geological, political, and cosmic events on a global scale, and to use that data in conjunction with price fluctuation data of any given commodity to form educated price predictions, and then perform trades following the generated criteria. The final product should be completely cutomizable to an individual's personal risk allowance, while still allowing accessibility to people with low start balances.

Machine learning will be utilised to aggregate all incoming data into quantifiable patterns, and a Graphical User Interface(GUI), will be integrated into the trading platform to visualize the pattern data for the end user, as such to facilitate placing trades manually.

The GUI will also allow for manual signals to be placed on a chart, and then a customized trading algorithm will be created, according to the specifications manually provided.

Users will also be able to follow other traders, based on a set of user-selectable filters, and copy their trade actions automatically.*

## Background

*"...But what does that have to do with the price of tea in China?..."  This project is necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing 'non-traditional' data, such as weather patterns, geological events, and cosmic events, in strict correlation to the market prices at the time of said natural occurances, for the purpose of placing trades on financial investment products. 

For instance: if there is a drought in the American Midwest that causes a grain shortage, the price of grain will increase globally, which could in turn affect the increase/decrease of other sectors(e.g. transportataion, retail, food service, etc.).

As another example: in Iceland, a volcano erupts, causing ash to be shot into the atmosphere and spread across Europe. In Sweden, the energy output of solar farms drops sharply, increasing cost of energy in the entire region.
The social aspect of the platform is necessary to allow traders of all skill level and starting capital to have the ability to profit from algorithmic trading.*

## Scope

*The scope of this project shall be specifically limited to the data utilizations as described above, with exceptions being made, as required to facilitate proper end functunality, in accordance with the primary focus of the program.

The project specifically SHALL NOT INCLUDE the utilization of data resulting from human interaction(e.g. civil unrest/war, political changes/elections, acts of terror, Non-Farm Payroll reporting, economic instability, etc.), except where such data is required to reinforce the primary data set.*

## Functional requirements

*The primary machine learning algorithm will be written in Python, with redundancies written in C++.
The base neural network will be built with: 
no fewer than 150 data points, and a maximum of 500 data points, in each direction, with correlations between a minimum of 3 separate factors(e.g. time<=>event<=>price), 
although more verifiable factors are acceptable to the formation of the neural network.

The program shall be back-tested to the earliest point of useable recorded data intersection, using time and market price as required variables. The backtesting and optimization shall continue prior to forward testing, until the program demonstrates the ability to predict winning trades with at least a 79.999% success rate.

The program shall be forward tested for a initial period of 3 months, after the backtesting/optimization, and prior to full market release. Forward testing will continue until the program demonstrates the ability to predict winning trades with at least a 79.99% success rate AND an account drawdown of less than 40% of initial account balance, over the timeframe in question.

Full market release will occur after both the backtesting, and forward testing have finished successfully.

The GUI will include the following areas:

  status of the neural network,
  
  register new account/login to account,
  
  account profile,
  
  social trading area,
  
  charting placement, and
  
  charting tools.
  
For security, all encryption used for the platform should be at least 512 bit, and two-factor authentication will be utilized, to increase end user security. 

The social trading area will be sortable for the user, using various filters(e.g. Win Rate %, Account Drawdown %, Type of events traded, etc.).*

## Personnel requirements

*The personnel for the project will need to be fluent in Python and C++. A general understanding of market fundamentals is requested, although not intially required.

Creative thinking skills, and the ability to 'think outside of the box' will be valued over market experience, as the intial neural network will be built manually, from non-traditional data correlated to financial market data.

After the full market release, the algorithm(s) will be optimized with an ongoing focus on both raw input data, and user initiated trades.*

## Delivery schedule

*The first phase of the project will include:

initial programming of the neural network, and
backtesting of algorithm(s).

The first phase will conclude with the successful demonstration of the program to predict trades with a minimum accuracy of 79.99%, and should last no longer than 2 months, from the start of the project.

The second phase will include:

foward testing of the algorithm(s), and
intial design of GUI and social trading area.

The second phase will conclude with successful demonstration of the program to predict trades with a minimum accuracy of 79.99%, AND a maximum account drawdown of 40%, from intial account balance, over the time in question. This phase will take a minimum of 3 months, from the start of the phase, but should not last longer than 6 months from the start of the phase. A primary deciding factor will be how quickly a solid 3 month block meeting the aforementioned requirements can be demonstrated. 

The third phase will include: 

secondary forward testing of the algorithm(s), and
final design of GUI.

The third phase will conclude with successful demonstration of the program to predict trades with a minimum accuracy of 79.99%, AND a maximum account drawdown of 40%, from intial account balance, over the time in question. This phase will take a minimum of 3 months, from the start of the phase, but should not last longer than 6 months from the start of the second phase. A primary deciding factor will be how quickly a solid 6 month block meeting all of the aforementioned requirements can be demonstrated.

The forth phase will include:

ongoing optimization of algorithm(s), and 
final debugging/ functionality testing of GUI and integration social trading area.

The fourth phase will conclude with successful demonstration of the program to predict trades with a minimum accuracy of 79.99%, AND a maximum account drawdown of 40%, from intial account balance, over the time in question. This phase will take a minimum of 3 months, from the start of the phase, but should not last longer than 9 months from the start of the second phase. A primary deciding factor will be how quickly a solid 9 month block meeting all of the aforementioned requirements can be demonstrated, and how quickly integration of GUI and social trading area can be accomplised.

The final phase will be full market release, and will take approx. 12 months from initial project start.*

## Other requirements

*Initial browsers supported will include:Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Tor, with other browers added as necessary.
Initial OS support include: IOS, Windows, Android, and Linux, with other OS's added as necessary.*

## Assumptions

*It will be hereby assumed that Python and all necessary associated frameworks will be used for the base machine learning algorithm(s). C++ will be used in a secondary role, for redundancy.
It is also assumed that a connection to:
weather data services such as: the National Climatic Data Center,
astronomy data such as data from NASA or the European Space Agency, and 
geological data services, 
will be maintained. It is also assumed that a connection to financial market data will be maintained, in order to facilitate successful utilization of input data.*

## Limitations

*This project will be strictly limited to the above parameters, with exceptions allowed only where absolutely necessary to the fulfillment of the primary objective.*

## Risks

*Potential risks and mitigations include but are not limited to:

Data Corruption => Provide redundant backups of all data

Over optimization => Fit the neural network over a longer timeframe, to account for standard deviation, and normalization errors.

Intergalactic invasion => utilize an underground bunker to help the human species survive, in the event that the visitors do not come in peace.*
